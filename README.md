# Dynamic Time Warping 

This package allows to measure the similarity between two time sequences, i.e. it finds the optimal alignment between two time-dependent sequences. It allows the calculation for univariate time series and multivariate time series. In addition, in the case of univariate time series, it incorporates the possibility of visualising the result in order to obtain a better understanding of the method used. On the other hand, the calculation of the DTW distance for multivariate time series can be parallelised. 

## Usage

The package can be used in three different ways:

1) Downloading the repository:

    a) Entering the parameters by terminal.  

    ```
    python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py -x 1 2 3 -y 1 1 1 -d "euclidean" -t "d" False False
    ```
   
    b) By file.

    ```
    python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py Libro1.csv
    ```

2) Making use of the API.
