# Dynamic Time Warping 

This package allows to measure the similarity between two time sequences, i.e. it finds the optimal alignment between two time-dependent sequences. It allows the calculation for univariate and multivariate time series. Any distance available in scipy.spatial.distance can be used. In addition, an extra functionality is incorporated to transform the resulting DTW matrix into an exponential kernel.

Univariate Time Series:
- It incorporates the possibility of visualising the cost matrix, as well as the path to reach the DTW distance value. This will allow it to be used in a didactic way, providing a better understanding of the method used. 

Multivariate Time Series: 
- The calculation of dependent DTW and independent DTW is available.
- The calculation can be parallelised.

## Usage

Based on the previous scheme, 3 different uses of this package can be observed: 

**1) Calculation of the DTW distance from the terminal.**

   An example covering all possible input parameters would be the following:
   ```
    python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py -x 1 2 3 -y 1 1 1 -d "euclidean" -t "d" False False
   ```
    
It is only necessary to indicate the x and y parameters, the rest, in case they are not set, will be selected by default values, defined in the configuration.py file. An example without the need to incorporate all the parameters:     
    
   ```
    python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py -x 1 2 3 -y 1 1 1
   ```
   **Remarks:**
   I have to indicate that the calculation of the DTW distance from the terminal, due to the complexity of the terminal handling, is limited for simple examples that allow a quick understanding:
   - Univariate time series. 
   - Dependent DTW.

**2) Calculation of the DTW distance by file input.**
    
   a) Example of calculation for time series from a .csv file: 
      
   The file used incorporates the data for the univariate x and y time series.
   
   ```
      python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py dtwParallel/Libro1.csv
   ```

   The file used incorporates the data for the multivariate x and y time series. 
   ```
      python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py dtwParallel/Libro2.csv
   ```

   b)  Example of calculation for time series from a .npy file: 

   ```
      python3 dtwParallel/__main__.py dtwParallel/X_train.npy
   ```

**3) Making use of the API.** 
 ```
 from dtwParallel import dtw_functions
 ```
For Univariate Time Series: 
 ```
 dtw_functions.dtw(x,y,type_dtw, distance, MTS, get_visualization, errors_control)
 ```
For Multivariate Time Series: 
 ```
 dtw_functions.dtw_tensor(x,y,input_object)
 ```
